# BIG DATA

## Topic

Failure Prediction

## Abstract

Our goal is to predict when different components of CNC machines will fail. We use time-series telemetry data obtained from sensors which include failure history, maintenance history, machine conditions and features such as the machineâ€™s age and model. The dataset was published on GitHub in 2018. It is around 77 Mb with 876100 samples of telemetry values for 100 machines for 1 year on an hourly basis. We will perform EDA and feature engineering to eventually implement 3 algorithms: decision trees, random forests and GBTClassifier. We will then evaluate the results based on different metrics such as accuracy, recall and F1 scores.
